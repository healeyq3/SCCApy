# NOTE

As of ~22:00est 05/10/24, the solver appears to be complete.

See the test_5_10.py file to run experiments. The project_environment.yml can also be loaded to use the same conda environment that I created for development.

To run an experiment, type the following in a terminal window from the main project directory (the same directory level as this README):

```bash
python test_5-10.py
```

You will be able to see an iteration counter as the code runs (to best see this I suggest that the terminal window is of at least a medium size).

# Running Tests

Run the following command from the main project directory.

```bash
python -m sccapy.tests.test_file_name
```
