# NOTE

As of ~22:00est 05/06/24, this repository contains unfinished code. 

To get to the experimentation phase the following steps are necessary.

1. "Fill out" the choose_subproblem and split_problem functions. This should not be too challenging as I have already established the logic in the attached bab-explanation.pdf and I have already created the boilerplate code.
2. Finish performing unit testing on the ProblemData, Bounder, and Objective classes.
3. Create experimentation and automated experimentation files.
4. Re-read repository to ensure everything is as it should be.

I still believe I can finish these agenda items by Wednesday May 8th, with Friday May 10th as a less-ideal case possibility.

Later on agenda items
1. Abstract the variable fixing like you did the bounding and objective function evaluating.
