# NOTE

As of ~22:00est 05/08/24, this repository contains unfinished code. 

However, to get to the experimentation phase only the following steps remain.

1. Finish performing unit testing on the ProblemData, Bounder, and Objective classes.
2. Create experimentation and automated experimentation files.
3. Re-read repository to ensure everything is as it should be.

I'm optimistic that I can begin experimentation by EOD Thursday 05/09/24.

Later on agenda items
1. Abstract the variable fixing like you did the bounding and objective function evaluating.
